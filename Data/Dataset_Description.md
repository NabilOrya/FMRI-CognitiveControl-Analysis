# Dataset Description

## Dataset Name
**Immaturities in Reward Processing** (Dataset ID: `ds000121`)

## Source
- **OpenfMRI** (now integrated into **OpenNeuro**)  
- Dataset Link: [https://openfmri.org/dataset/ds000121/](https://openfmri.org/dataset/ds000121/)

## Study Purpose
This dataset focuses on examining how **immature reward processing** influences **inhibitory control** in adolescents and young adults. Participants performed a modified **antisaccade task** under different reward conditions while undergoing **functional MRI (fMRI)** scanning.

## Participant Information
- **Population**: Children, adolescents, and adults (ages 3 to 12 years, plus adult group)
- **Health Status**: Healthy, no neurological or psychiatric disorders reported

## Task Details
- **Task**: Modified antisaccade task  
- **Conditions**:  
  - **NEUTRAL** (task performed without reward)  
  - **REWARD** (task performed with reward incentive)

The antisaccade task demands **high cognitive control** to suppress automatic eye movements, making it ideal for studying brain regions associated with **executive function and reward processing**.

## fMRI Acquisition Parameters
- **Number of slices**: 29
- **Repetition Time (TR)**: 1.45 seconds
- **Slice timing information**: Provided in milliseconds
- **Scanner**: 3T MRI scanner (standard field strength for cognitive neuroscience studies)

## Purpose for Current Analysis
In this project, the dataset is used to identify **brain regions** that show increased activity during **cognitive control tasks** and to examine how **reward conditions** modulate brain activation patterns.
